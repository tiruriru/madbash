# Mad Bash

This is my personal bash configuration bundle built with "implement when needed" approach to
end up with slim pack of utils that I actually use. If you like this minimal approach feel
free to fork this repo and work your own bundle around it.

## Installation

To install Mad Bash just execute the following line in your terminal:

    $ curl -sL http://git.io/7Alm5w | bash
    
That's it!
